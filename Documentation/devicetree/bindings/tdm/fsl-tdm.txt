TDM (Time Division Multiplexing)

DESCRIPTION

The TDM is full duplex serial port designed to allow various devices including
digital signal processors (DSPs) to communicate with a variety of serial devices
including industry standard framers, codecs, other DSPs and microprocessors.

The below properties describe the device tree bindings for Freescale TDM
controller.
This TDM controller is available on various Freescale Processors like
MPC8313, P1020, P1022 and P1010.

PROPERTIES

  - compatible
      Usage: required
      Value type: <string>
      Definition: Should contain "fsl,tdm1.0".

  - reg
      Usage: required
      Definition: A standard property. The first reg specifier describes the
          TDM registers, and the second describes the TDM DMAC registers.

  - clock-frequency
      Usage: optional
      Value type: <u32 or u64>
      Definition: The frequency at which the TDM block is operating.

  - interrupts
      Usage: required
      Definition: Definition: Two interrupt specifiers.  The first is TDM
          error, and the second is TDM EMAC.

  - phy-handle
      Usage: optional
      Value type: <phandle>
      Definition: Phandle of the line controller node or framer node eg. SLIC,
          E1/T1 etc.

  - fsl,max-time-slots
      Usage: required
      Value type: <u32>
      Definition: Maximum number of 8-bit time slots in one TDM frame.
          This is the maximum number which TDM hardware supports.

EXAMPLE

	tdm@16000 {
		compatible = "fsl,tdm1.0";
		reg = <0x16000 0x200 0x2c000 0x2000>;
		clock-frequency = <0>;
		interrupts = <16 8 62 8>;
		phy-handle = <&zarlink1>;
		fsl,max-time-slots = <128>;
	};
