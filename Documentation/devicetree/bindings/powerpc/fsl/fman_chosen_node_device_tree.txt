FMan Extended Args Node

DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this node it to provide means to implicitly initialize some of the
FMan advanced arguments as described below. This node is entirely optional; i.e.
the FMan Linux driver already sets the appropriate default values that should
fit most of the standard applications.

PROPERTIES

  - compatible
      Usage: required
      Value type: <string>
      Definition: Must include "fsl,fman-extended-args"

  - cell-index
      Usage: required
      Value type: <u32>
      Definition: Specifies the index of the FMan unit. The index should match
        exactly the numbering of the cell-index of the FMan device-tree node.
        It is recommended to use the "reference-to-node" method to assure matching.

  - dma-aid-mode
      Usage: optional
      Value type: <string>
      Definition: Sets the AID mode.
        The optional values are "port" and "tnum".

Example

fman1-extd-args {
    cell-index = <1>;
    compatible = "fsl,fman-extended-args";
    dma-aid-mode = "port";
};

FMan-Port Extended Args Node

DESCRIPTION

The purpose of this node it to provide means to implicitly initialize some of the
FMan-port advanced arguments as described below. This node supports all FMan-Port
types: OP, RX, 10G-RX, TX and 10G-TX ports. This node is entirely optional; i.e.
the FMan Linux driver already sets the appropriate default values that should
fit most of the standard applications.

PROPERTIES

  - compatible
      Usage: required
      Value type: <string>
      Definition: A standard property.
          An Offline-Parsing port must include "fsl,fman-port-op-extended-args".
          The Rx port must include "fsl,fman-port-1g-rx-extended-args" or
          "fsl,fman-port-10g-rx-extended-args" for 10G Rx ports.
          The Tx port must include "fsl,fman-port-1g-tx-extended-args" or
          "fsl,fman-port-10g-tx-extended-args" for 10G Tx ports.

  - cell-index
      Usage: required
      Value type: <u32>
      Definition: Specifies the index of the FMan Port unit.
          The types of ports: offline-parsing, 1G Rx, 10G Rx, 1G Tx and 10G Tx
          ports. The index should match exactly the numbering of the cell-index of the
          FMan-Port device-tree node. It is recommended to use the "reference-to-node"
          method to assure matching.

  - num-tnums
      Usage: optional
      Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
      Definition: Specifies the number of tnums required (first value)
        as well as the extra required tnums (second value).
        In the fman-port case "tnums" represent the number of tasks that the
        Fman controller allocates to handle the appropriate port RX or TX activities.
        For more details please refer to the Fman RM.

  - num-dmas
      Usage: optional
      Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
      Definition: Specifies the number of dmas required (first value)
        as well as the extra required dmas (second value).
        In the fman-port case "num-dmas" represent the number of dma channels
        that the Fman controller allocates to handle the appropriate port
        RX or TX activities.
        For more details please refer to the Fman RM.

  - fifo-size
      Usage: optional
      Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
      Definition: Specifies the fifo size required (first value)
        as well as the extra size required (second value).
        In the fman-port case "fifo-size" represent the size of memory (in bytes)
        that the Fman controller allocates to handle the appropriate port
        RX or TX activities.
        For more details please refer to the Fman RM.

  - buffer-layout
      Usage: optional
      Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
      Definition: Specifies the manipulation extra space needed (first value)
        and the data alignment (second value).
        For more information please refer to the FMan User's guide

  - vsp-window
      Usage: optional
      Value type: <prop-encoded-array>
      Definition: Specifies the number of profiles for this port (first value)
        and the dfault virtual port eelative id (second value).
        For more information please refer to the FMan User's guide

  - errors-to-discard
      Usage: optional
      Value type: <u32>
      Definition: Specifies which errors should be discarded.
        Errors that are not in the mask, will not be discarded;
        I.e. those errors will be enqueued and sent to the default error queue.        

Example

fman1_rx4-extd-args {
    cell-index = <4>;
    compatible = "fsl,fman-port-1g-rx-extended-args";
    num-tnums = <16 0>;
    num-dmas = <8 0>;
    fifo-size = <0x3000 0>;
    buffer-layout = <64 128>;
    vsp-window = <8 0>;
    errors-to-discard = <0x00020000>;
};
