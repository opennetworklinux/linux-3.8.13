config FSL_DPAA_OFFLINE_PORTS
	bool "Offline Ports support"

	default y
	---help---
	  The Offline Parsing / Host Command ports (short: OH ports, of Offline ports) provide
	  most of the functionality of the regular, online ports, except they receive their
	  frames from a core or an accelerator on the SoC, via QMan frame queues,
	  rather than directly from the network.
	  Offline ports are configured via PCD (Parse-Classify-Distribute) schemes, just like
	  any online FMan port. They deliver the processed frames to frame queues, according
	  to the applied PCD configurations.

	  Choosing this feature will not impact the functionality and/or performance of the system,
	  so it is safe to have it.

	  termination traffic (e.g. 4K and above).
	  NOTE: This option can only be used if FSL_FM_MAX_FRAME_SIZE

	  Using this option in combination with small frames increases

	  the system memory.

	---help---
	  The DPAA-Ethernet driver defines a ndo_select_queue() callback for optimal selection
	  of the egress FQ. That will override the XPS support for this netdevice.
	  If for whatever reason you want to be in control of the egress FQ-to-CPU selection and mapping,
	  or simply don't want to use the driver's ndo_select_queue() callback, then unselect this
	  and use the standard XPS support instead.

	  The maximum number of buffers to be by default allocated in the DPAA-Ethernet private port's
	  buffer pool. One needn't normally modify this, as it has probably been tuned for performance
	  already. This cannot be lower than DPAA_ETH_REFILL_THRESHOLD.

	---help---
	  The DPAA-Ethernet driver will start replenishing buffer pools whose count
	  falls below this threshold. This must be related to DPAA_ETH_MAX_BUF_COUNT. One needn't normally
	  modify this value unless one has very specific performance reasons.

	---help---
	  The size in bytes of the egress Congestion State notification threshold on 1G ports.
	  The 1G dTSECs can quite easily be flooded by cores doing Tx in a tight loop
	  (e.g. by sending UDP datagrams at "while(1) speed"),
	  and the larger the frame size, the more acute the problem.
	  So we have to find a balance between these factors:
	       - avoiding the device staying congested for a prolonged time (risking
                 the netdev watchdog to fire - see also the tx_timeout module param);
               - affecting performance of protocols such as TCP, which otherwise
	         behave well under the congestion notification mechanism;
	       - preventing the Tx cores from tightly-looping (as if the congestion
	         threshold was too low to be effective);
	       - running out of memory if the CS threshold is set too high.
